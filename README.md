Currently a work-in-progress

This is a web-application made using MERN-stack technologies which consists 
of a common discussion board where users can post their thoughts or share 
information and code in pure text format. The posts made on the board get
wiped out after fixed intervals to maintain volatility and optionally
anonymity.
